## 📊 Feasibility & Industry Analysis

### 1. Industry Behavior
Recruiters in the film industry prioritize **efficiency and trust** over open discovery.
*   **Challenge:** Professional casting relies heavily on trusted networks (agents, referrals) rather than scrolling through unverified feeds.
*   **Strategy:** The platform must build trust through verification systems and efficient filtering tools for recruiters.

### 2. Technical Complexity
*   **Requirements:** Scalable video storage (CDN), recommendation engines for the feed, and secure role-based authentication (RBAC).
*   **Scalability:** Handling high-quality video content and real-time messaging requires a robust backend architecture.

### 3. The "All-in-One" Trap
*   **Risk:** Combining portfolio, hiring, social feed, and chat can dilute the value proposition.
*   **Mitigation:** Focus on a strong MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that solves the core problem of *discovery* and *trust* before expanding too broadly.

### 4. Adoption Challenges
*   **Gatekeeping:** Established filmmakers often delegate discovery to casting directors who may stick to traditional methods.
*   **Trust:** Union rules and contract concerns make new platforms risky for major productions.
*   **Solution:** Focus initially on independent productions, commercials, and digital content creators where barriers are lower, while building reputation.
